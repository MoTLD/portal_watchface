`[Portal Sign plus Health - now with Battery!]`

Fork of gingeneer/portal_watchface found [here in the app store](https://apps.rebble.io/en_US/application/556382a65c83e51dbb000091) and noiob/portal_watchface found [here](https://apps.rebble.io/en_US/application/5832c17200355a8634000185)

A version of degygii's Portal themed Watchface, which is made to look like the posters in the beginning of the level. noiob didn't like having battery percentage displayed all the time, so they made it more useful (by displaying health instead of battery). I like having battery displayed, so I put it back under health as a smaller bar. Also, the health bar now shows % of 10000 steps instead of varying the scale based on average steps. Also, I disabled the BT icon because I run in airplane mode a lot.

This watchface is under the MIT License (check source link for details).

It displays time, date and the Step Goal progress as the progress graph. The face contains twenty tiles which change randomly every half hour.

## Features:

- Bluetooth disconnection and reconnection vibration

- Charging indicator icon (in 1st tile)

- random tiles change every 30 min

- step goal indicator (counts towards 10000 steps)

- battery indicator

- no fall damage
