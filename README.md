# Portal Sign +ðŸ’Ÿ

`[Portal Sign plus Health]`

Fork of gingeneer/portal_watchface found [here in the app store](https://apps.getpebble.com/en_US/application/556382a65c83e51dbb000091)

A version of degygii's Portal themed Watchface, which is made to look like the posters in the beginning of the level. I don't like having my battery percentage displayed all the time, so I made it more useful. This watchface is under the MIT License (check source link for details).

It displays time, date and the Step Goal progress as the progress graph. The face contains twenty tiles which change randomly every half hour.

## Features:

- Bluetooth disconnection and reconnection vibration

- Bluetooth disconnect icon (in 3rd tile)

- Charging indicator icon (in 1st tile)

- random tiles change every 30 min

- step goal indicator (counts towards average steps for today)

- no fall damage
