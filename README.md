# Portal Sign +ðŸ’Ÿ - now with Battery!

`[Portal Sign plus Health - now with Battery!]`

Fork of gingeneer/portal_watchface found [here in the app store](https://apps.rebble.io/en_US/application/556382a65c83e51dbb000091) and noiob/portal_watchface found [here](https://apps.rebble.io/en_US/application/5832c17200355a8634000185)

A version of degygii's Portal themed Watchface, which is made to look like the posters in the beginning of the level. It displays time, date, and steps/HR and battery as the progress bars. The face contains twenty tiles which change randomly every half hour.

noiob didn't like having battery percentage displayed all the time, so they made it display steps instead of battery. I like having steps but I also like having battery so I put battery back as a smaller bar under the health bar. And I wanted HR, so the health bar is now split to show % of 10000 steps on the top half and bpm out of 200 on the bottom half. Finally, I disabled the BT icon because I run in airplane mode a lot.

This watchface is under the MIT License (check source link for details).
